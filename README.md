# HackerEarth-Solutions-beginner_level

90% of the solution are in C.
Some are in C++ and Python3.

These are the solutions, I wrote in my 1st year of College.
One may find that some of them are less optimized, but all of them works with 100% correctness.(Dude, i was just a beginner at that time)
This is intended towards students, new to this field and finding it difficult to solve.
# PURPOSE IS THAT ONE MUST TRY TO READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THE APPROACH USED.
As i get free time i will keep on commiting to this repo with more solutions.

Keep visiting, much more solutions from HackerEarth are coming soon.
